# HOOKS
Introduced after React 16.8.  
Older react used class-based components but now functional are used.  

To achieve state, lifecycle, other features of class componenents in functional components, we use hooks.

Popular Hooks :- 

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useRef
5. useReducer

### Common stuff -
1. Starts with `useHookname`
2. Always used with functional component
3. Always on top, not inside any (if, sub block, brackets)
