**WHAT IS REACT ?**  
Open source Js **library**,

**HOW IT WORKS?**  
Creates virtual DOM  
Only changes what needs to be changed as previously, DOM used to refresh the whole webpage

React Project Essentials -
- Vite  
Recommended in Offical documentation

### Our First React App

   Go to https://vite.dev/guide/ for steps
1. Open terminal and go to folder location.
2. `npm create vite@latest`
3. Will ask to name project,  
Select framework - react,  
Select variant - Javascript
4. `cd ProjectName` 
5. `npm install`  
All above steps will add needed files for the App.
6. `npm run dev`

Your project should now run on **localhost : 5173** (Viteâ€™s default port).
