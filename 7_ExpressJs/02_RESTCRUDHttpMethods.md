# RESTful API
Representational state transfer   

Way for applications to communicate with each other over internet using standard HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

We dont send request in html format as it might wont work with moblie applications  
We do send them in json format 

This json data is brought by RESTful API (Application progam interface)

# CRUD

C : Create => **POST**, To send data to server, Add new data, Eg Form   
R : Read => **GET**, To retrieve data from server  
U : Update => **PUT** : To update an existing record  
D : Delete => **DELETE** : To delete a resource
