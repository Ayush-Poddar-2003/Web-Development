### Our First React App

   Go to https://vite.dev/guide/ for steps
1. Open terminal and go to folder location.
2. `npm create vite@latest`
3. Will ask to name project, Select framework - choose react, variant - select Javascript
4. `cd ProjectName` 
5. `npm install`  
All above steps will add needed files for the App.
1. `npm run dev`

Your project should now run on **localhost : 5173** (Viteâ€™s default port).
